# sprocket-mods
This repository contains information, design files and instructions on how to modify a specific type of 35mm camera to shoot non-standard formats. The most common formats for conversion are half-frame (17 mm x 24 mm) and square frame (24 mm x 24 mm). Modifying any camera to shoot one of these smaller formats requires four steps.

1. Mask the frame opening in the film chamber to expose a smaller area of film.
2. Create indicators in the viewfinder representing the new field of view.
3. Modify the film advance to eliminate excess space between frames.
4. Change the frame counter to accurately represent the number of photos that the camera can capture on a roll of film (optional).

Steps one a two are pretty straightforward and don't require any specialized replacement parts (instructional resources are available in the wiki). Step 3 is the most challenging. The mods covered here all rely on a specific type of film advance mechanism commonly found in motor driven SLRs from the 1990s. It involves replacing a small PCB with a custom part, which changes how the camera counts the number of sprocket holes being advanced. More details can be found on the wiki. PCB design files are stored in the repo, which can be downloaded and used to order parts from online PCB manufacturing services. For these electronic cameras, step 4 is often unnecessary, and the camera will count the correct number of frames after conversion.

A list of cameras eligible for modification are listed here. It is not an exhaustive list but it does cover most of the major camera systems of the era. I will update the list as new camera mods are developed and tested.
